#arithmetic operators
print(x+y) # addition
print(x-y) #subtraction
print(x*y) # multiplication
print(x/y) #division
print(x%y) # modulus- tells us remainder from a division
print(x**y) #exponentiation
x =  9.191823
print(x//y) #floor division-how many times does a number go into another without remainder

#Assignment operators- work on two different numbers
x = 9 # sets x equal to 9
print(x)
x += 3 # adds 3 to x, x=x+3
print(x)
x -= 3 #x =x-3
print(x)
x *= 3 # x = x*3
print(x)
x /= 3  #x x= x/3
print(x)
x **= 3 # x = x**3

#comparision Operators
x = 9

print(x==y) #true if x equals y, false otherwise
print(x!=y) #true if x does not equal y, false otherwise
print(x>y) #true if x is greater than y,false otherwise
print(x<y) #true if x is less than y,false otherwise
print(x>=y) #true  if x is greater than or equal to y,false otherwise
